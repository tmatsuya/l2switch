Layer2 switch project (Work In Progress)
-----------------------------
[> Directory Structure
 /cores/      Cores library, with Verilog sources, test benches and documentation.
 /boards/     Top-level design files, constraint files and Makefiles
              for supported FPGA boards.
 /doc/        Documentation.

[> Support Boards
1- Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA Connectivity Kit
2- Xilinx KC705 and FM-S14

[> Building tools
You will need:
 - Xilinx Vivado 2014.1

[> How to build
1- cd boards/kc705/synthesis
2- ./make_gui.sh (you need run vivado) or ./make_batch.sh

[> Quickstart
1- connect serial and JTAG cables
2- cd boards/kc705/synthesis
3- ./load.sh (or ./flash.sh)
